  Stage 0 Notes for Debi Stocks<p></p>
<b>I have learned how the web works:</b> I now understand that when a person goes to a specific website it sends an HTTP request to a server and that server finds the HTM and returns it back to the requesters computer, where in turn the web browser interupts the page and displays it. 
<p><b>HTML:</b><em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML is what the majority of content on the web consists of. Within the HTML there are various funtions that dictate te appearance of the content that is view. called markup. You can also insert links to various other URLs, add images and format your content to a variety of layouts.</p>
<p>I have learned the defination of: <b>Tag:</B> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag <b>, example and a closing tag.</b> Some tags do not require a clsoing tag (like the bracket br bracket tag).</p>
<b> <p>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everthing within a set of opening and clsoing tags.</p>
<p></p><b>Attrbutes:</b>This is the proprty o an HTML element. For example to set a href attritbute of an anchor tag to a certain URL, you would write Bracket tag ATTR ="URL" contents bracket tag bracket</p>
<p><b>Inline vs Block</b> br with brackets stands for inline - which in essences just wraps your text. p with brackets stands for block, which in essence is a "box" of text  which will have a height and width.</p>

<b>Note:</b> I used the word bracket in place of < as needed to demostrate the layout of the content.
